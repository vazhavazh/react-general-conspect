<h1>REACT</h1>
<h2>React is a library for building user interfaces.
    Facebook created React
</h2>
<h3>SPA(single-page-application)</h3>
<p>
    A single-page application is an app that works inside 
    a browser and does not require page reloading during use. 
    You are using this type of applications every day. 
    These are, for instance: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.

    // So client request only one per pages HTML, JS, CSS.
    // for example: If client want to get to another page by navigation, 
    // this is executing on front end
    // no need more request to server( back-end) 
    // also client still have oportunity to make request to back-end and ask for some data 
</p>
<h3>SPA advantages:</h3>
<h4>
    1) Web page is not reloading during navigation over the page
    2) Instantly(МОМЕНТАЛЬНО) re-rendering web-page' s elements, 
    cause we have ability rerender certain(ОПРЕДЕЛЁННЫЕ) elements(only which we want), not all page
    3) Easier for publication in production cause it have small quantity of static files
    4)Internet connections will be more effective due to decrease their quantity and decrease delay between requests  
    and only first acess to site will be "long" and other one "react"
</h4>
<h3>SPA disadvantages:</h3>
<p>
    1) For SEO need special options, becuse SPA have only one page 
    2) Long first connection due to big JS file
</p>
<h2>REACT BASE</h2>
<p>
    
    Reloading whole DOM is hard operation.
    React have 'virtual DOM' which is only JavaScript's object 
    So before changing real DOM react change virtual DOM and as virtual DOM is object, 
    it happens almost instantly.
    So  per each change on page firstly change virtual DOM only after real DOM
    Example:
    Botton clicked // so state of some element(button) has changed
    react firstly change state in the element which is in virtual DOM 
    but as this element has children, 
    then changing his state will call changing chuldren's state automatically.
    And this is give ability also to change them or to left them 
    // After react compare 2 DOM's states(VERSIONS or CONDITIONS):
    CURRENT AND PREVIOUS
    React compares it by each changed element by comparing their state(СОСТОЯНИЯ) to find what exactly change in element.
    After react defines which exactly elemnts were changed and which with out changes(differences):
    (for example one element changed his 2 children also chenged another 3 children were left with out changes)
    So only this changed lements wil be re-rendered in real DOM.
    There is no full page re-render.There is only selective rendering(Точечная перересовка)ю
    So Virtual DOM collected little bit changes and then only real DOM rendering
</p>
<h2>BASE CONCEPTS IN REACT</h2>
<h3>
    -Components (building blocks of React applications.
    They are independent and reusable parts of the user interface that can have their own internal state and properties (props).)
    
    - JSX (Jsvascript Syntax Extencion)  This is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows combining HTML-like(CSS) tags 
    and JavaScript expressions into a single React component. 
    JSX simplifies the creation of components and improves code readability.

    -PROPS(СВОЙСТВА) (pass data from the parent component to the child component.)

    -STATES(СОСТОЯНИЯ) (State allows storing data that can change during the component's lifecycle. )
</h3>


<h2>components</h2>
<h3>characteristics of components</h3>
<p>
    - Components are reusable in different part of application
    - Components provide clear and hierarchical(иерархическую) systemю
    -  Components can be controlled from the outside using props(СВОЙСТВА) // they are like "arguments during call function"
                                                                            // cause arguments give oportunity to control function behavior
                                                                            // or control the result of function
    - Each component can have his own state(Состояние).Each state affects on component and his children but not parrent's elements.
    -  Each component is responsible for a separate part of the logical interface.

<p>
    Component consists: HTML, CSS, JavaScript // they are united(объеденены) in one component
    <p>
        // BETTER WITH ARROW FUNCTION BECAUSE variable with const cannot be assigned by another value
const HelloWorld = () => {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>  // return in JSX format
}

////////////////////////////////////////////
// Class component

class HelloWorld1 extends Comment {
    render() {                          // mandatory method render(), determines what is to be rendered
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>    // return in JSX format
    }
}

<h3>IN JSX there are custom(ПОЛЬЗОВАТЕЛЬСКИЕ) and built-in(ВСТРОЕННЫЕ) components in JSX</h3>

<h4>React distinguish(различает) type of component by first letter after opening tag "<".
If it is capital letter it is custom component
If it is small letter it is built-in component</h4>
<h4>JSX must have one root element</h4>
<h2>PROPS(СВОЙСТВА) and STATES(СОСТОЯНИЯ) </h2>
<h3>Component's props are getted prom parrent component </h3>
<p>We can not sent props from child component to parrent component</p>
<h4>Component should not change it's own props</h4> // for this target we have parent element
<h4>Component can change it's own state and can not change other component's state // 
    but can influence(влиять) on changing state of other components by request </h4>
    <h4>It is possible to transfer component's some props and states to it's children's components as props </h4>
    <h4>Component will be re-render, if it's props or state changed</h4>
    <h2>React hooks</h2>
    <h3>Reack hooks give ability to control state in functional components</h3>
